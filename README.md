# CCBill Helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aaronklaassen/ccbill_helper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aaronklaassen/ccbill_helper)

Although it's slowly been improving, CCBill can be kind of a pain to work with.
Let's take some of that pain, wrap it up in Ruby, and stuff it under the rug.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ccbill_helper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ccbill_helper

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. A lot of "first, set this up in CCBill" stuff.

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
